Gestor is an innovative open-source application for universal Minecraft mod management.

## About

It combines three types of tools into a single app:

1. Mod and modpack hosting (CurseForge, Modrinth) with Markdown pages (CommonMark3 standard)
2. Automatic mod installing/updating/removing
3. Launching Minecraft (Forge, Fabric and Quilt) with multiple profiles

The app is powered by the [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [JetPack Compose Desktop](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/).
